## Run the Dashboard

### 🚀 Quick start (one command)

```bash
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh -d # for devloper mode

chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh -p # for production mode
```

This will:

- Install Python (if missing) and tools for your OS
- Create/activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Run database migrations
- Start the Django server using the configured host/port

### 🔧 Manual setup

```bash
# 1) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Run migrations and start the server
cd evilpunch
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### ⚙️ Configure host, port, and admin login

- Edit `evilpunch/config/config.json`:
  - `dashboard_host` (default `0.0.0.0`) and `dashboard_port` (default `9000`)
  - `dashboard_username` and `dashboard_password`
- On startup, these credentials are ensured for an admin user.
- To use a different config path, set `REVERSE_PROXY_CONFIG_PATH` or `CONFIG_PATH`.

### 🚪 Access the dashboard

- Local: `http://localhost:9000`
- Remote/LAN: `http://<server-ip-or-hostname>:9000` (open the port in your firewall)
- Log in with the credentials from `config.json` (default `admin` / `admin`). Change them immediately.

### 📝 Notes

- The development server binds to the host/port from `evilpunch/config/config.json`.
- If exposing beyond localhost, set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `evilpunch/evilpunch/settings.py` for production use.
